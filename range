#The range() Function
#To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the range() function,
#The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.
for x in range(6):
  print(x)
#Note that range(6) is not the values of 0 to 6, but the values 0 to 5.
#The range() function defaults to 0 as a starting value, however it is possible to specify the starting value by adding a parameter: range(2, 6), which means values from 2 to 6 (but not including 6)
for x in range(2, 6):
  print(x)
#The range() function defaults to increment the sequence by 1, however it is possible to specify the increment value by adding a third parameter: range(2, 30, 3)
for x in range(2, 30, 3):
  print(x)
